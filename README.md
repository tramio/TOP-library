# Library!

**What?** A website where users can suggest nice reads, built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) ([instructions here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library)) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The data entered is saved locally and disappears on page reloading. üìö

**When?** It took me about eight days in September 2021 *(3 months into my coding journey)*.

**Where?** See it live [on GitHub Pages](https://tramio.github.io/TOP-library/).

## Challenges:
- This was my first time using objects and object constructors in a project. Creating the very first functions took me lots of googling!
- Scope, scope, scope! I've had a tough time trying to figure out why variables returned from my functions sometimes couldn't be passed as arguments in other functions.
- Reading the first chapters from Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code* as part of The Odin Project book club was **a blessing**! It opened my eyes on so many practices and radically changed the way I want to write / read code. Sadly, with great power there must also come great responsibility: the information was so overwhelming I had to take a 2-weeks break to reflect on my practices. I didn't code but thought about it everyday, all day ‚Äî *still a better love story than Twilight*.
- In previous projects, I could content myself of looking at the errors thrown in the console and fix them directly in my editor. This time, most errors weren't visible in the console, so I had to make use of breakpoints. This helped lots solidifying my debugging game. üîé

## Discoveries:
- Learned how to create a **modal box**! To make a form appear or disappear on click, I thought I needed to generate HTML using JS. This can actually be done using CSS!

## Notes:
- I'm rather proud of my new debugging skills. üòÉ

## Things I need to learn more about:
- Scopes. *Scary* üèÉü¶ñ
- When to use em / px in CSS
- How to make better use of SVGs: currently, when I want to add icons to my projects, I simply save the SVG files from the Google Fonts website... Which isn't the greatest? In this project, I'm using a black cross SVG to delete a book DOM element. What if I want to make it grey? Gotta look into this!
